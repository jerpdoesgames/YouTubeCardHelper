# YouTubeCardHelper
Simple command line tool to read subtitle files and list out times where desired keywords occur.  Made to help with setting up YouTube cards in videos.

If you're curious about what it's all about, refer to this Twitter thread:

I'll make a proper readme later if I come back to it, but works well enough for now (3/10/2021) and I'm currently backed up with trying to actually add cards based on the data I've already compiled so far.


To use, just dump your VTT's (seemed to be the simplest format to get from YouTube via YouTube-DL) into `My Documents/CardCaptions` and run the tool.
